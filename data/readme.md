# Data folder üóÇÔ∏è

This directory contains the following:
- **DatasetS1.json**: generated by ```src/data_Extraction/PATRIC_extract_data.sh``` ;  
`json` file from [this paper's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43549-9#Sec23) _Supplementary information_.  
There are 12 bacterial species (ESKAPEE pathogens) and each has a set of PATRIC accession numbers for the genomes.
- **PATRIC_IDs**: generated by ```src/data_Extraction/PATRIC_extract_data.sh```  
It has a text file of species specific accession ids for each of the 12 species, extracted from the json file. 
- **genomes:** also generated by ```src/data_Extraction/PATRIC_extract_data.sh```  
It has the genomes of the 12 species, downloaded from PATRIC using the accession ids.
- **pangenomes:** generated by ```src/create_pangenomes.sh```  
Contains the roary pipleine output for all species, including the gene_presence_absence matrix.
- **graphs:** graphs objects generate fro code to construct a gene network.
- **old:** old files and directories that are not relevant at this stage.
- **phenotypes:** generated by ```src/data_Extraction/extract_phenotypes.sh```  
Contains the phenotypes for each species-drug combination, extracted from the paper's _Supplementary information_, SIR readings binarized and csv files of this header:
