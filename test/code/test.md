I am a senior undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Bioinformatics at the Lebanese American University. For my advanced studies, I have chosen the Master's program in Computational and Mathematical Biology as my sole training program. Given its interdisciplinary nature, delving into research in bioinformatics demands a robust foundation in various fields such as biology, computer science, and mathematics. Throughout my undergraduate courses, I have been introduced to diverse aspects of bioinformatics and have cultivated a strong set of theoretical and practical skills, adequate to initiate exploration within specific domains of the field.
My enthusiasm for biological research is profound, particularly in utilizing computational and mathematical methodologies to contribute to the field. The intricacies of mathematics and algorithms captivate me, and I derive joy from tackling computational challenges. Pursuing a graduate degree is my aspiration to deepen my understanding of the computational and mathematical dimensions of biology, as well as to explore diverse approaches for addressing biological problems. I believe that acquiring a solid theoretical background and delving into statistical, algorithmic, and mathematical modeling theories is crucial at this step of my learning journey.

The Master's program I have chosen offers a comprehensive range of courses that align perfectly with my learning objectives. Its unique structure provides a balanced blend of theoretical and practical courses, precisely what I seek for my graduate studies and distinct from other programs. The inclusion of research and internship components is a crucial step forme to gain hands-on experience in real-life projects, especially in a high profile institution like CENTURI. Furthermore, the program's reputation is commendable, and I have observed the remarkable work of some of the professors and researchers in the field. The opportunity to learn from and collaborate with them would be invaluable.

Upon completion of this program, my goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Computational Biology and continue conducting research in the field. I aspire to work as a computational biologist in a research institution, engaging in life sciences projects that necessitate computational and mathematical methodologies to analyze the ever growing biological data and apply logical thinking to advance the discipline of biology. Ultimately, I aim to actively contribute to the computational biology community, and I view this program as the initial step towards this world of research and discovery.
